<strong>The Big Bang</strong>
</h1> 

<p> Written by Angelica Knudsen </p>

<p>
  <strong> What is the Big Bang? </strong> <br>
<ul>
  <li>The Big Bang is a very popular theory about how the universe expanded from a very teeny singularity and into the giant universe. </li> 
  <li>A singularity is an infinitely dense point, which I came up with from google’s definition. </li>
</ul></p>

<p>
  <strong> Let's see how the Big Bang could have played out! </strong> <br>
<ol>
  <li>The universe started as an infinitely tiny, dense, and hot mass surrounded by nothingness. </p> </li>

 <li> <p> It begins expanding, even faster than the speed of light, containing a huge amount of neutrons, electrons, protons, and many other types of subatomic particles. You may have heard the expansion of the universe being referred to as red shift. </p> </li>

  <li> <p> One second in this expansion, the universe has cooled down enough for neutrons to decay into protons and other particles. They’d combine together to create the first element, hydrogen.
  </p> </li>

  <li> <p> During this time, there were still a bunch of free electrons. This means that they weren’t part of atoms yet. Because of this, the universe was opaque with light. The electrons scattered photons, which are light particles, everywhere. This is similar to how sunlight is scattered in the water droplets of clouds, making them visible and white in color. This light can still be detected, and its leftover radiation is called the cosmic microwave background, also known as CMB. The image below is the CMB. </p> </li>

  />

  <li> <p> As the universe proceeded to cool, the free electrons would combine with protons and neutrons to create more hydrogen atoms and some other types of atoms. Now the universe is clear because of light being able to shine through them. </p> </li>

  <li> <p> The universe cools even more. Gravity causes the atoms, mainly hydrogen, to get drawn together to form stars and galaxies. </p> </li>
